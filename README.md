Here is 'Ophidian Crawler' (version 0.01) a small snake game without right angles.
Please give me your feedback about this game.

The head of the snake is the yellow circle, and to grow you must eat 'vitamin' (the red circle).
Each vitamin add one green circle to the snake's body.

You loose when :
- your head hit your body
- your head is out the screen for more than 5 seconds (a little gauge appears)

The score computation :

Each time you eat 'vitamin' your earn 50 points and a bonus about the half of the length of your snake.
The bonus is earn in five parts, each second after the fifth second you ate the 'vitamin'
Those bonus are cumulative, and the number in red shows you the ammount of bonus to earn

I like the minimalist graphic of the game.

Enjoy !
